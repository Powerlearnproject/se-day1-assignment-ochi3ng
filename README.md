Overview
Linear and Sequential: Waterfall follows a strict, linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. The process is often described as a series of steps: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance.
Documentation: Emphasis on comprehensive documentation at each stage.
Advantages
Clear Structure: Each phase has specific deliverables and deadlines, making it easier to manage and track progress.
Defined Requirements: Requirements are collected at the beginning, reducing the risk of scope creep.
Predictable Timelines: With a detailed plan and set phases, timelines, and budgets can be estimated more accurately.
Disadvantages
Inflexibility: Changes are difficult and costly once a phase is completed. If requirements change, the project might need to revisit earlier stages.
Late Testing: Testing happens after the build phase, which may delay the discovery of critical issues until late in the project.
Appropriate Scenarios
Regulatory or Compliance Projects: Projects requiring strict adherence to regulations and standards, such as banking or healthcare systems.
Small Projects with Fixed Requirements: Projects with clear, unchanging requirements, such as a basic internal tool or a minor software update.
Agile Methodology
Overview
Iterative and Incremental: Agile promotes iterative development and incremental delivery, with a focus on customer feedback and flexibility. Development occurs in cycles called sprints or iterations, with continuous reassessment and adaptation.
Collaboration: Emphasizes collaboration between development teams and stakeholders, with frequent communication and feedback.
Advantages
Flexibility: Agile allows for changes and adaptations throughout the project based on evolving requirements or feedback.
Early and Frequent Delivery: Regular releases of functional software provide value early and often, with each iteration improving the product.
Continuous Feedback: Regular stakeholder involvement ensures the product aligns closely with user needs and expectations.
Disadvantages
Less Predictable: Frequent changes and iterations can make it challenging to predict project timelines and costs accurately.
